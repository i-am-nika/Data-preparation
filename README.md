# Data-preparation
Pre-processing, feature engineering, processing data for ML prediction models


## 1 step: PRE-PROCESSING:
preprocess.py

Pre-process Text Data. The program takes one command-line argument - a text file for pre-processing. 
If you run the program without a command-line argument, 
you'll be asked to type an url of the website you want to pre-process.

The programm gives you the choice to make any/all of the following steps:

- clean data from html tags
- tokenisation
- remove/keep capitalisation
- remove/keep punctuation
- delete english stopwords
- delete own stopwords
- lemmatisation
- stemming
- show frequency distribution
- remove/keep duplicates of tokens
- write output to a file


(2 and 3 steps of processing are coming soon)
